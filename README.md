## CCB Live Map ##
Pulls information from CCB ([Church Community Builder](http://www.churchcommunitybuilder.com)) into a MySQL database and creates a real time interactive map of events occurring on the campus.

Using a SVG Map we are able to change the color of which rooms / buildings on campus are being used and display what event is occurring with other metadata regarding it.

- Monthly & Daily recurring events (only weekly work right now)
